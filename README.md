# Loan_Analysis

This is the final project for class CIS9360 Programming for Analytics, which entails doing a general analysis and a Regression analysis for the 300k+ loan data of a delusional bank.

This project demostrates my skill to clean, remove outliers, come up with data visualization and analysis using Python and key libraries, and find out key insights from the data.
